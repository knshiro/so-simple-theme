We actually didn't make any registry list for you to conveniently buy us stuff we don't need :)

**But we accept money of course, so we can buy ourselves stuff we don't need**

You can either:

* bring some money in whichever form you prefer the day of the wedding, there will be a box for that
* Or you can give us bitcoins here:
